\biography
This page is optional. If you do plan to use it, keep in mind that it should have a page number and it should be listed in the Table of Contents. The bio should appear on the very last page of your dissertation.

A brief biography, ordinarily no more than one page in length, unless listing publications or academic honors.  Be sure to not include sensitive information like your date or place of birth.  

Although, your biography should not resemble a CV, it could include the following in an essay format  (1) the colleges and universities that you attended with the degrees received and their dates, (2) a list of scholarships, fellowships, memberships in honorary societies, and academic honors you have received since obtaining the bachelorâ€™s degree.  You can also list the titles of all books and articles you have published.  If you choose to list publications, be sure the format is similar to the bibliography/references section.  Each entry should be single spaced, with a double space between each entry.
