\abstract
In the abstract, you must (1) present the problem of the thesis/dissertation, (2) discuss the materials and methods used, and (3) state the conclusions reached. Individual chapters should not have abstracts.
 
Note that this will be the first numbered page: it is page \textit{iv}; pages \textit{i}, \textit{ii} and \textit{iii} (copyright, signature page and abstract signature page) were counted but not numbered. If you look ahead, you will see that numbering up to the first page of text is in roman numerals. On the first page of Introduction or Chapter One, begin numbering at Arabic number 1. This numbering (1, 2, 3, 4 \dots) is consecutive through the rest of the document. 

Also note that the page margins are set with a 1.5-inch margin on the left side and a 1-inch margin on the top, right side, and bottom, throughout the entire document.

The page number below should be above the 1-inch margin and centered to the page margins, not the page edges.
